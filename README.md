2. App displays various weather data for that specific city
3. User has the option to add the city in it's "favorite cities" list

## Technologies Used

## Additional Info
  The App was developed as an assignment for a job application as a junior developer, it was my first ever complete interaction with React, JS, CSS and Web development in general. Despite the relatively small size of the project, it allowed me to transcript and apply my -at the time- existing knowlege and expirience from Android development in a new, fascinating context.
